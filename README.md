# Kotlin Roadmap

## **What is and why Kotlin?**

Kotlin is an [open source](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin), [multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html), modern, statically and strongly typed language that aims for simplicity, productivity, and code safety. The latter was designed with simplicity and flexibility in mind. It provides a concise syntax for common use-cases and a rich [standard library](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/) to avoid writing boilerplate code. It includes nullability support within its type system to avoid `NullPointerException`s. Furthermore, it contains a well thought [structured concurrency system](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) making asynchronous tasks simple and performant. Its compiler made the creation of the next generation declarative UI toolkit [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) possible by leveraging the features of the Kotlin language.

## **Want to try Kotlin?**

Try this free course [Kotlin Bootcamp For Programmers](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011) by Google on the [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) platform. In this course, Aleks Haecky and Sean McQuillan walk you through the Kotlin language from the basics such as the language syntax and functions, to the advanced topics like classes, generic.

Want to learn more, visit the [Kotlin Language website](https://kotlinlang.org/) or the [Kotlin YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Kotlin) to stay up to date with the latest news by the Koltin team.

Kotlin provides an online [playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org/) to play with Kotlin without the need of any installations.

## **What is and why building for Android?**

[Android](https://www.android.com/) is an [open source](https://source.android.com/) operating system for mobile devices such as phones, tablets and watches, it also supports TVs and cars. It has¬†**over 2.5 billion** active users spanning over 190 countries, in addition to a huge and mature community of developers and experts all around the globe. Google also provides a lot of guidance and libraries to make android developement as easy and simple as possible. That includes [blog posts](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers), [documentations](https://developer.android.com/reference), [guidance](https://developer.android.com/guide), events such as [Android Developer Summit](https://developer.android.com/events/dev-summit), [Google I/O](https://io.google/) and [Android App Excellence Summit](https://developersonair.withgoogle.com/events/app-excellence-summit-2022), and modern tools as [Android Jetpack Libraries](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

## Andorid Learning Paths:

In this course [Developing Android Apps with Kotlin](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012) with the help of Lyla Fujiwara; Dan Galpin; Aleks Haecky; Sean McQuillan and Murat Yener, you will learn how to build android apps with Kotlin covering all basics topics such as layout, navigation with fragments, lifecycle, app architecture, networking and more.

Once you got the basics right, you can check out the following course [Advanced Android with Kotlin](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-with-kotlin--ud940) for expanding your knowledge even more through learning some advanced topics, notifications, animations, graphics and testing to name a few examples.

The two courses mentioned previously are using XML to define layouts. For those who are interested in Jetpack Compose (and you should **üòÅ**), consider taking this course [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course). Concerning app architecture, look at this course [Modern Android app architecture](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-architecture).

And of course for building an app you should always keep in mind that you build it for everyone. For this, consider taking this course [Accessibility](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/make-your-android-app-accessible) to make sure your app is usable by everyone, including people with accessibility needs.

Certainly your app might need to do some long runnning operations, doing the latter on the main thread might cause your app to be [janky](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jank#:~:text=jank%20(uncountable),operations%20or%20poor%20interface%20design.), thus Kotlin Coroutines comes to the rescue. For the sake of using coroutines, this course [Kotlin coroutines](https://developer.android.com/courses/pathways/android-coroutines) and this [documentation](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) are available for teaching you how to use coroutines within your android app in a proper manner.

Ultimately, I belive this article would be helpful for those who are intersted in Koltin if you have any more information; article; course or videos, consider sharing them since sharing is caring!
